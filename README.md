Overview
The provided scripts are designed to manage player permissions within specific colliders in VRChat. The primary goal is to restrict unauthorized players from entering a designated area and provide an interactive mechanism (a button) for players to gain access.

Scripts Breakdown
1. ColliderPermissionCheck
This script is responsible for managing player permissions and ensuring unauthorized players are teleported out of a restricted area.

Key Variables:
restrictedCollider: The collider that represents the restricted area.
teleportLocation: The location where unauthorized players will be teleported to.
playersWithPermission: An array of players who have been granted permission to enter the restricted area.
Methods:
OnTriggerEnter(Collider other): Triggered when a player enters the restricted collider. If the player doesn't have permission, they are teleported to the designated location.

Update(): Continuously checks if any player is inside the restricted collider. If a player without permission is found inside, they are teleported out. This ensures that even players who somehow bypass the OnTriggerEnter (e.g., by teleporting directly inside) are also handled.

GrantPermission(VRCPlayerApi player): Grants a player permission to enter the restricted area. The player is added to the playersWithPermission array.

HasPermission(VRCPlayerApi player): Checks if a player is in the playersWithPermission array, i.e., if they have permission.

2. BoxButtonPermission
This script turns a GameObject (like a cube) into an interactive button. When players interact with this button, they are granted permission to enter the restricted area.

Key Variables:
permissionManager: A reference to the ColliderPermissionCheck script, which manages player permissions.
Methods:
Interact(): Triggered when a player interacts with the GameObject. The player is granted permission to enter the restricted area by calling the GrantPermission method of the permissionManager.
Workflow:
A player approaches the restricted area.
If they enter the restricted collider without permission, they are immediately teleported out.
The player interacts with the designated button (e.g., a cube with the BoxButtonPermission script).
The button grants the player permission by adding them to the playersWithPermission array in the ColliderPermissionCheck script.
Now, the player can enter the restricted area without being teleported out.
